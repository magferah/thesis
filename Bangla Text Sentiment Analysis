firstly, a specific domain-based categorical weighted lexicon data dictionary (LDD) is developed for analyzing sentiments in Bangla.

secondly, a novel ruleâ€“based algorithm termed as Bangla Text Sentiment Score (BTSC) is developed for detecting sentence polarity. 
This algorithm considers parts of speech tagger words and special characters to generate a score of a word and thus that of a sentence and a blog.

Thirdly, two feature matrices are developed by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to the two datasets,
and by using the corresponding BTSC scores

Next, supervised machine learning classifiers are applied to the feature matrices. Results show that for the case of BiGram feature, support vector machine (SVM) 
achieves the best classification accuracy of 82.21%  indicating the effectiveness of BTSC algorithm in Bangla SA.
